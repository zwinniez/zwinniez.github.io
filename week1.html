            <p>"Long Live the Web" by Tim Berners-Lee discusses a lot of principles and ethics behind the Web and the Internet.
                As a day to day user, things like net neutrality and universality don't come across my 
                mind even though I am ALWAYS on the web. One of the ideas discussed was that people seem to think
                the Web is some sort of piece of nature, and it if starts to "wither, that's just one of those
                unfortunate things we can't help". It really opened my mind that the Web was constructed from scratch, its
                principles and purposes created and defined by mankind, and is now the greatest tool for us to
                communicate with each other. It is both absolutely extraorindary that while the Web was growing, 
                we were able to set certain guidelines and rules (like net neturality and cybersecurity) at a global
                scale.

                I found "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush 1945 to be very eye opening as to think of
                technology and science in a different perspective, especially through the eyes of 
                a scientist. This article reminds me of the ever lasting conflict between man and science,
                and how we need to and should evaluate our progress/development in the field of science. I was
                also really surprised to realize that this was written in 1945 because a lot of the doubts Bush 
                talks about still applies today, which is haunting to think about because his warnings were about 
                what we are afraid of/love modern day.
